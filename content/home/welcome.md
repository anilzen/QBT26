The Quantum BioTechnology Conference (QBT26) aims to highlight the current state of the art in quantum sensing, quantum reporters, quantum control, and quantum analysis of complex, large scale biological data and to identify opportunities in technology development. 

To bridge the gap from innovation to impact, the conference will determine the needs of the biomedical community for improved sensing, reporting, control, and analysis capabilities. Our goal is to identify the most pressing needs in national workforce development in quantum information science and engineering, a field identified as critical to U.S. technological leadership.
